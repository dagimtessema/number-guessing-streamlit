#  🎯 Number Guessing Game with streamlit and ML components
A simple Python and streamlit-based number guessing game that challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 200 with difficulty selection with improvement analysis and feedback. It is simple and interative to run through the streamlit platform and a local browser. This project is great for beginners learning Python and Machine learning fundamentals.

##  🚀 How It Works
. The program generates a random number between 1 and 200 based on user's difficulty selection between "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard".
. The user is prompted to guess the number.
. If the guess is incorrect, the game continues using a loop until the correct number is guessed.
. The user is given clues by advising to guess higher or lower.
. Input validation ensures only numeric guesses are accepted.
. After a minimum of 2 attempts, the user can view the results of the pattern analysis based on an improvement rate algorithm.
. Once the correct number is guessed, a final strategy analysis is presented.
. Sidebar sections with attempts, guess history and game tips are displayed on the browser.
